		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am a rising senior at <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a> double majoring in computer science and linguistics. I'm very good at spending too long in front of computers and very bad at organizing my food, hence the existence of this app, developed for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/jbs-2015-cosi/home">2015 JBS on Voice, Mobile, and Web Applications</a>.</p>

		<h2>About Reciperack</h2>
		<p>As mentioned, Reciperack is supposed to help you categorize and refer back to your recipes, without anything else getting in the way.</p>
